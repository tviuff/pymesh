# GDF

Geometry package that handles basic geometry and facilitates the creation of 3-dimensional surface panels. These surface panels are converted into a low-order geometric data file (GDF) for import and use in [WAMIT](https://www.wamit.com/).

## Building 3-dimesional surfaces

`gdf` is based on object-oriented programming and the user will be interacting with the following classes when building the geometry:

- Points and vectors:
    - `Point(x, y, z)` auxilliary point in 3-dimentional space for creating other points, vectors, curves and surfaces
    - `Vector3D(Point, Point)` auxilliary 3-dimentional vector for creating surfaces
- Curves:
    - `Line(Point, Point)` creates a straight line between two points
    - `Arc3P(Point, Point, Point)` creates a circular arc defined by a center point, a starting point and an ending point
    - `ArcPVA(Point, Vector3D, angle)` creates a circular arc based on a point swept by an angle around a vector axis
- Surfaces:
    - `CoonsPatch([Curve, Curve, Curve, Curve])` creates a 3-dimensional surface using four boundary curves
    - `PlaneSurface(Point, Point, Point)` creates a plane surface based on three points
    - `SweptSurface(Curve, Curve)` creates a surface by sweeping a curve along the path of another

## Inspecting the final geometry

The `GDFViewer` is based on the `matplotlib` package and is used to conveniently plot and inspect the surface panels and their normals.

## Writing to a *.gdf* file

The `GDFWriter` takes care of converting the surfaces into a usable *.gdf* file.

## Example files

The folder `Ã¨xamples` contain various use examples of the `gdf` package.
