# MESH GENERATOR

The package `mesh generator` is used for creating quadrilateral panel mesh for import and use in [WAMIT](https://www.wamit.com/).<br>
The current implementation only supports creation of Geometric Data File (GDF) as part of the low-order method in WAMIT.

The package is based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and gives the user the ability to use the following classes:

- Points:
    - `Point`
- Curves:
    - `Line`
    - `Arc3`
- Surfaces:
    - `CoonsPatch`
- GDF generation:
    - ****To be implemented****

## Functionality to be implemented

### Code behaviour



### Modules to use

- **unittests**, set up test procedures
- **exceptions**, create custom ones
- **logger**, could be smart for later GDF generation
